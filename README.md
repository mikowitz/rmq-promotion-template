rmq-promotion-template
===================

A basic [http://www.rubymotion.com/](RubyMotion) iOS application template using
[http://infinitered.com/rmq/](RubyMotionQuery) and
[https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion](ProMotion).

This template is based on the default RMQ template. In fact, it is the same
template app, with the following changes:

* `/controllers/main_controller.rb` has been moved to `/screens/main_screen.rb`
in keeping with ProMotion convention
* creating the nav bar uses ProMotion helper methods
